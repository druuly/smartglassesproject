* this is just the script, not the virtual environment
* the virtual environment library should use a 3.9.23 interpreter (this is to be compatible with the applications)
* the virtual environment libary should have installed deepface, pandas, pyaudio, speech_recognition, tensorflow, and opencv_python
* note that i am on mac
